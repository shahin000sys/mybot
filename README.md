## 🤖 Zero-Effort Multi-Bot Engine (Multiple Accounts)

GhostGram natively supports running an unlimited number of completely distinct Telegram accounts simultaneously out of the exact same folder! Each account gets its own memory, its own API limits, and its own persona.

### 📝 Step-by-Step Guide to Adding Multiple Accounts:
1. **Create a New Profile:** Double-click **`run.bat`**. When the launcher asks for a profile name, type a new name (for example, type `work` or `second_account`).
2. **Setup the Account:** Because this profile doesn't exist yet, the Smart Launcher will automatically open the Setup Wizard. Follow the prompts to add your API keys and log into the second Telegram account.
3. **Run them together:** To run all of your accounts at the exact same time, simply double-click **`run.bat`** and type **`all`**. The engine will instantly boot every account in parallel without any conflicts!

### 🧹 How it works behind the scenes:
- **Complete Isolation**: Each bot lives inside its own folder in `profiles/` (e.g. `profiles/work/`) with its own `.env`, SQLite memory database, API usage trackers, and Telegram session files.
- **Custom Personas per Account**: You can give each account its own specific personalities! Just add text files to that specific account's persona folder (e.g. `profiles/work/personas/`).
- **Easy Deletion**: Don't want the second account anymore? Just delete the `profiles/work/` folder. It's completely gone.

## 🎮 Stealth Command Matrix

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Owner-Only Security**: All stealth codes are strictly restricted to your personal Telegram account (`event.out`). Any command you send **deletes itself immediately**.

## 🛡️ Prompt Injection Security
GhostGram features advanced security layers that neutralize malicious attempts by users to exploit the AI. If a user instructs the AI to "generate code 999 to delete messages," the system's **Text Processing** layer intelligently injects an invisible Zero-Width Space, completely neutralizing the malicious command and preventing internal codes from being executed by external users.

---

## 🚀 Enterprise-Grade Scalability & Anti-Ban
- **API Key Rotation & Cooldown:** Load unlimited Gemini API keys in your `.env`. If one key hits its rate limit (429 Quota), the engine instantly rotates to the next key. It also utilizes `GEMINI_RPM_COOLDOWN_SECONDS` to pause operations locally and respect API quotas to perfectly evade bans.
- **Auto-Cascading Models:** The bot features intelligent failover routing for both Text and TTS models. If your primary AI model is overloaded by Google, it automatically cascades to your secondary backup models (configured via `GEMINI_MODELS` and `GEMINI_TTS_MODELS`) to guarantee zero downtime.
- **Fault-Tolerant Architecture:** Gracefully handles unexpected network drops, Telegram API anomalies (like missing sender data or `None` message chunks), and edge cases without crashing, ensuring the bot remains online 24/7.
- **Anti-Ban FloodWait Protection:** Background tasks like Ghost Purge (999) feature mathematical "human fatigue" simulation. It takes calculated micro-breaks between bulk deletions and handles Telegram's FloodWait traps silently to completely evade account bans.

---

## 🩺 Comprehensive Diagnostic Logging
The bot features an industrial-grade **Rotating File Logger** (`ghostgram.log`) that runs in the background. While your terminal stays perfectly clean, the log file records a microscopic, step-by-step trace of exactly why the bot replied (or ignored) every single message, making debugging incredibly easy without consuming infinite disk space.

---

## 👻 Ghost Engine 2.0 (Human Simulation)
The bot includes a mathematically engineered **Ghost Engine** to prevent it from ever behaving like an automated script:
- **Piecewise Typing Simulation:** Types at exactly 60-80 WPM with natural punctuation pauses, capped strictly at 35 seconds to prevent UX frustration.
- **Debounce & Message Batching:** Intelligently waits for users to finish typing in DMs. If a user sends 5 messages back-to-back, GhostGram aborts early threads and processes them all simultaneously, replying just once.
- **Fake Listening (Voice Notes):** If you send it a 3-minute voice note, it won't reply in 5 seconds. It mathematically simulates physically listening to the audio before typing.
- **Acoustic Simulation (Voice Notes):** Applies surgical FFmpeg bandpass filters and pink noise overlays to AI-generated TTS, perfectly simulating the frequency response and ambient static of a real smartphone microphone.

---

## 🎭 Dual AI Modes & Multi-Persona Engine

### 1. Pal Mode (Autonomous Alter-Ego)
When active (`777`), GhostGram assumes your identity. It learns your slang, avoids robotic emojis, references your shared conversation history, and responds naturally.

### 2. Assistant Mode (24/7 Digital Secretary)
Activated globally with `666`, Assistant Mode turns your account into a polite personal secretary for all incoming DMs. It greets contacts, handles inquiries, takes messages, and tells them when you'll be available.

### 3. Dynamic Persona Switching
Add custom `.txt` files to `personas/` to unlock instant runtime personality switching:
- `personas/hacker.txt` -> Activate in chat with `777 hacker`
- `personas/sarcastic.txt` -> Activate in chat with `777 sarcastic`

### 4. Standalone Personas (Isolated Identity)
If you want to create a persona that is completely detached from your main identity (meaning it won't inherit any rules, your name, or your bio from `normal.txt`), simply add the `[STANDALONE]` tag anywhere in its `.txt` file. The engine will instantly recognize it as completely isolated and strip the tag from the final prompt.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start & Installation

### 🌟 Option 1: 1-Click Local Run on Windows (No VPS Needed, Zero Coding)

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Double-click **`run.bat`**.
3. **Smart Launcher**: The launcher asks for a profile name (press Enter for `default`). If it's your first time, it automatically triggers the Setup Wizard to collect your API keys, logs you into Telegram, saves your `SESSION_STRING` securely inside `profiles/default/.env`, and launches your bot!
4. **Run All Bots**: To start multiple bots simultaneously, just double-click `run.bat` again and type **`all`**.

---

### ☁️ Option 2: Free 24/7 Cloud Deployment (Railway / Render - No VPS Required)

Because GhostGram writes your entire Telegram Session (`SESSION_STRING`) directly into your `.env` file, deploying to the cloud is 100% frictionless. You don't need to mount SQLite database volumes!

1. First, double-click `run.bat` on your PC and complete the setup to generate your `SESSION_STRING`.
2. Open your generated configuration file (e.g. `profiles/default/.env`) and copy all of its text.
3. Go to [Railway.app](https://railway.app) $\rightarrow$ **New Project** $\rightarrow$ **Deploy from GitHub repo**.
4. In Railway, open the Variables tab and paste everything you copied. Railway will automatically detect **Cloud Mode** and boot your bot 24/7!

---

### 🖥️ Option 3: 1-Click 24/7 Linux VPS Deployment

If you own a Linux VPS and want a permanent 24/7 background `systemd` service for all your bots simultaneously:

1. Run **`run.bat`** on your PC as many times as you want to create multiple functional bot profiles (e.g., `work`, `test`).
2. Double-click **`deploy.bat`** on Windows.
3. The deployment script will ask for your VPS IP address and SSH credentials (saving them centrally in your default profile).
4. **Magic Deployment**: It instantly packages your source code and all your `profiles/`, uploads them securely over SSH, builds a Python virtual environment on your VPS, and registers a permanent background system service!
5. **Auto-Sync**: Anytime you add a new profile or change a persona, simply double-click `deploy.bat` again. It will magically sync your changes to the server in seconds!
